## Describe the OOP design of your GWack Slack Simulator

Please provide a short description of your programming progress

With my Programming progress, I implemented a nice gui client that connects to a server. With features such as "connect" which connects to the socket and "send message" which sends a message! Not only that one can input their own username and join the chat server to talk with other class mates. Furthermore, I also added error windows to notify the client when they have an invalid input, and a message window to notify the client that they joined the server successfully

## What additional features did you attempt and how can we test them

I attempted to re decorate the gui, added my own logo and a scrollbar! I iitially added status and topography but failed to do so.. I removd them in order to maintain a neat and organized gui,
